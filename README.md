## Software Engineersâ€™ Pay Is Rising Faster Outside Silicon Valley

The above headline is from an [article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/software-engineers-pay-is-rising-faster-outside-silicon-valley-11581550773) of the WallStreet Journal, and represented, at least for myself, a somewhat suprising statement. In that, Silicon Valley is oft taken to be the Mecca of Technology and Software Engineering, such that one would expect the greatest increases in Software Engineering remuneration therein. Yet, reality differs from thought, for conceptions aside, Sillicon Valley is no longer the exclusive hub for technology it once was as comapnies expand their operations to other sites such as Austin, Toronto and London, to meet increased demand. Now it may seem to some that the greater relative increments elsewhere are meant to attract and retain talent in a contention of Software Engineers with Sillicon Valley. However, the article seems to suggest that this is caused by a dearth of qualified Software Engineers (some 350,000 more Software Engineers are needed for present demand to say nothing of future demand).

In any case, I view the development of additional hubs of techonology and for them to offer greater relative increments in remuneration so that these remunerations gradually grow to be equal to Sillicon Valley for us all as students of Software Engineering.

I think you brought up an interesting article, and the heading was a surprise to me as well. However, come to think of it, the dearth of software engineers has unlocked other places as a contestant to the bay area. Regardless, I think the higher demand for engineers opens doors for opportunities for software engineering students like us. Thank you for sharing the article.
